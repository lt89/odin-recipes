Recipe site for practicing HTML and later CSS
This site is built to practice my newly learnt HTML coding skills. The website consists of a main index page linking to three recipe pages. I will add CSS in the future as this exercise was to mainly practice HTML. 

I have now added CSS attributes to my website.
